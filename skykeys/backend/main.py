"""FastAPI application entry point for SkyKeys MVP.

This module wires application startup, shutdown, and API routing. All
implementations are intentionally left as TODOs with descriptive
instructions so that future contributors can fill in the async logic for
search aggregation, caching, and health checks.

# NOTE: Keep dependencies minimal in the scaffolding layer. Actual
# implementations should be added once business logic is ready.

# TODO: replace placeholder FastAPI import with the actual framework
# implementation and configure lifespan events for Playwright and cache
# connections.
# from fastapi import FastAPI


# TODO: instantiate FastAPI with title/version/metadata that match the
# SkyKeys branding and expose routers for the search and health
# endpoints. Consider separating router registration into a dedicated
# function for testability.

# TODO: define async route handlers for `/search` and `/health` that
# delegate to service-layer functions. Ensure all responses conform to
# the documented API schema and include error aggregation metadata.


# TODO: configure middleware for CORS, rate limiting hooks, request
# logging, and global exception handling aligned with the Norisk-inspired
# UX (e.g., user-friendly error messages).
