/**
 * Netlify Function entry point for the SkyKeys search endpoint.
 *
 * This module is responsible for orchestrating adapter execution, in-memory
 * caching with TTL, normalization, deduplication, and response assembly that
 * mirrors the original FastAPI contract. All logic is intentionally left as
 * TODOs so that implementation teams can port the Python scaffolding to
 * Node.js/TypeScript when ready.
 */

// TODO: Import the Netlify handler types once the implementation is ready.
// import type { Handler } from '@netlify/functions';

// TODO: Instantiate a shared in-memory cache (e.g., Map) that survives across
// warm invocations. Provide helper utilities for TTL eviction aligned with the
// 45-minute caching requirement.

// TODO: Load scraping adapter manifests and configuration metadata from the
// new adapters directory. Consider dynamic imports to keep bundle sizes small
// and allow toggling adapters via environment variables.

// TODO: Implement the handler that executes adapters in parallel with
// concurrency controls, collects errors, normalizes offers, performs
// deduplication, and returns the best offer alongside metadata flags.
// export const handler: Handler = async (event) => {
//   throw new Error('search function not implemented yet');
// };

// TODO: Ensure the handler respects Netlify's execution limits (10s default)
// by enforcing adapter timeouts, retry limits, and graceful degradation when
// some sources fail.

// TODO: Surface debugging information via console.log for Netlify log drains
// and include structured fields (source, duration, status) similar to the
// previous scrape_logs table.
